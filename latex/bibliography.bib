abstract = {The convergence of increased remote working and rising cybersecurity threats have created a severe challenge for organizations. As firms continue to embrace remote working, the challenges of cybersecurity threats and risks remain unresolved. This study draws upon the Peltzman Effect and the complacency framework to explore how remote working may trigger a moral hazard regarding employee cybersecurity awareness and security-based precaution-taking. Data collected from 203 remote workers across the US provide strong support for the research model. Contrary to widely held beliefs about remote working, the results indicate that remote working is positively associated with cybersecurity awareness and security-based precaution-taking. The findings further show that information security policy compliance moderates the effect of remote working on cybersecurity awareness. In addition, the study reveals that as remote workers gain cybersecurity awareness, they are more likely to apply security-based precaution measures. The study complements current theoretical frameworks on security-precaution behaviors and provides insights to managers grappling with remote working in the face of burgeoning cybersecurity threats.}
